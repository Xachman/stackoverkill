    <h1>Why is testing so hard?</h1>

    <p>One would think that if you could put together a process that enabled you to be sure your code worked even when changed or refactored everyone would do it. Yet today many of the most prevalent developers advocate for never testing. And even the ones who do advocate for testing tell you not to follow aggressive testing processes like TDD. One starts to ask if testing is even a valuable part of the development process.</p>

    <p>One thing that interferes with our testing ambitions is the lack of standards. You should definitely unit test. The tests are going to be faster. Developers won't want to run tests if they aren't fast. As soon as you finish reading that article you will read one that says you should only ever run Integration tests. Of course these are more expensive and less performant. But they test how your interfaces and modules interact. End to end tests are going to be done either manually or by automation and they will be the slowest. But your tests will be run as real world application users would. So obviously that is best? Do I do all of them? But I havenâ€™t even built anything yet? This fragmentation creates doubt. Not doubt testing will help you build and maintain your application but doubt that you will follow the right testing strategy.</p>

    <p>Even if you do decide that you are going to do unit testing or integration testing or something like this you have to figure out how to do it and when to do it. TDD gives you a straightforward method to tell you when to test. You test before writing any code. You just write the test first. I know you are right now mocking out the console printing methods in your language of choice in order to ensure your hello world example code works. This presents the first problem of when to test. There are some scenarios where testing just does not really need to be done. Where the application is so small or the purpose so nominal that testing just does not seem necessary.</p>
