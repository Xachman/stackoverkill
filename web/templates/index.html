            <p>Welcome to Stack Overkill, where we dig deep into the layers of modern developmentâ€”from clean code to chaotic deploys, cloud quirks to database decisions, and the occasional existential dread of a semicolon out of place.</p>

            <p>Whether you're wrangling containers, architecting abstractions, or just here for the hot takes on hosting, this blog is your sandbox for everything programming, app dev, and tech that runs deeper than your call stack.</p>

            <p>Too much tech? Maybe. Too nerdy? Definitely. Too much fun? Never.</p>
